	abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine the relevant characteristics and motivations of 1144 international players of FIFA Ultimate Team for spending money on player packs (i.e., loot boxes). Loot boxes have been compared to gambling mechanics as they may both reinforce problematic behavior. Results showed employment status and sensitivity for rewards predicted spending on loot boxes, and that this behavior was motivated by the need for competence, autonomy and relatedness. Severity of gaming disorder also positively predicted spending behavior, both directly and indirectly through players’ need for autonomy. Although time spent playing was the strongest predictor of in-game success, the amount of money spent on loot boxes also improved players’ in-game ranking. Combined, gaming disorder and the perceived benefits to players’ ranking, competence, autonomy and relatedness contribute to the financial success of this monetization mechanic.}

abstract = {Background
Gambling can be motivated by both its hedonic value and by attempts to cope with dysphoric or stressful states. Thus, motivations constitute important mechanisms linking mood fluctuations and gambling. However, little is known about how different kinds of affective disturbance, such as mood elevation and dysphoria, motivate gambling behavior.
Methods
To estimate relationships between different mood experiences and gambling motivations, we recruited 4125 Internet gamblers via hyperlinks placed on gambling Web sites. Mean (SD) age of respondents was 35.5 (11.8) years, with 79.1% (3263) being male and 68.8% (2838) UK residents. We collected ratings for 11 gambling motivations. We used principal components analysis, followed by hierarchical linear regression, to model the relationships between motivation factor scores and gambling behavior, depressive symptoms, hypomanic experiences, deliberate self-harm, and alcohol and substance misuse.
Results
Gambling to regulate mood, gambling for monetary goals, and gambling for enjoyment were enhanced in individuals at heightened risk of problematic gambling, with mood regulation and enjoyment factors being enhanced in female compared with male problem gamblers. Lowered mood reduced the enjoyment motivation, whereas previous mood elevation enhanced it. Gambling problems alongside previous hypomanic experiences or current dysphoria enhanced gambling to regulate emotional states.
Conclusions
Recent theorizing argues that mood disorders and pathologic gambling may share aspects of pathophysiology. Different forms of emotional disturbance, such as mood elevation and dysphoric states, which confer heightened risk for bipolar disorder and depression, are associated with divergent motivations that might represent distinct pathways into gambling behavior.}
