### Topic

Loot boxes in video games and their link to problem gaming

### Abstract

Loot boxes are crates in video games that contain randomized game content. Generally, adolescents are more prone to play video games. More than 2 billion people worldwide play video games for relaxation. To create more profit from their products, video game developers are implementing these loot boxes in their games. Every game in the TOP 5 leaderboard on SteamCharts.com (up to 04.10.2022) contains loot boxes. Creating more games with loot boxes creates an issue linking loot boxes with problem gambling. This article will focus more on the psychological features of loot boxes and how they should be regulated for young audiences or even deemed illegal.
